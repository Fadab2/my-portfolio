    "description": "ðŸ‘‹ Hi, my name is Edris Berg. I am a software developer. My background is in Network Administration and Security. I have experience with information security through an internship in healthcare. I also have knowledge of computer networks through an internship and certifications. I also gained great customer service and time management skills while running my online Shopify stores, driving for Uber, and selling on Amazon. I am passionate about software development and building apps and tools so I decided to become a software developer. I believe my background in information technology coupled with being a team player and problem solver will give me advantages in my new career. Some of my interests include soccer, computer and network security, music, travel, nature and I am a good cook. ",
